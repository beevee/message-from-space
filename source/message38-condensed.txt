Is a function that takes an "interaction-protocol", some data (maybe "protocol" dependent), and some pixel. 
It returns some new data, and a list of pictures.

Note that during the execution it sometimes uses the :doc:`send <message15>` function to communicate with spacecraft.

    // list function call notation
    f38 g (a,b,c) = if a == 0
                    then (modem b, multipledraw c)
                    else interact g (modem b) (send c)
    interact g a b = f38 g (g a b)



    // mathematical function call notation
    f38(g, (a,b,c)) = if a == 0
                    then (modem(b), multipledraw(c))
                    else interact(g, modem(b), send(c))
    interact(g, a, b) = f38(g, g(a, b))
